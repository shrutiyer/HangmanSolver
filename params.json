We are thinking of making one AI that plans its moves ahead of time and one that impulsively just chooses the maximum points available at the time.\r\n\r\nLearning Goals:\r\nPaul: I want to learn about more efficient data structures that will allow our team to process huge numbers of words relatively quickly and efficiently. I think that this will be an important skill for this project and for many projects to come. I especially would love to get a better understanding of algorithms for solving puzzles like this.\r\nMeghan: I would like to learn more about how to better structure my code and how to code with a team (including better use of Github). I also really like the idea of creating an algorithm that solves a problem. Although this project is specific to solving a game of hangman, I think algorithm building is a skill that would be applicable to many other projects.\r\nShruti: I would like to learn about the architecture of code and how it affects the efficiency and understanding of the code. I would also like to understand how to approach a new library and parse its syntax.\r\n\r\nImplementation Plan:\r\nThe goal is to create a Scrabble AI with a smaller dictionary of words (about the size of 1000 words). We then plan to make two AIs to solve and play scrabble in two different ways. Initially, we just want an ASCII output of the board with Scrabble alphabets. We will build and test one working algorithm and then move to the second one. \r\n\r\nProject Schedule:\r\nDesign Review (4/2):\r\nHave a completed, detailed overview of the code architecture\r\nPseudocode for the algorithms we will be trying \r\nCode Review (4/13):\r\nWorking game\r\nAt least one rough but functioning algorithmz\r\nMid-Project Presentation (4/23):\r\nTwo fully functioning algorithms\r\nFinal Product (5/6):\r\nMake presentation look pretty.(GUI/Interactive visual interface?)\r\n\r\nCollaboration Plan:\r\nWe plan to start out together, pair programming until we have a clear idea about the code architecture and then branch out. We will individually read up on documentation and then get together to pair program. Initially, there wonâ€™t be individual parts to work on until we get to the display/GUI portion of the project. \r\n\r\nRisks:\r\nIt might end up taking a long time to run because our program will have to cycle through such a long list of words. We are trying to combat this risk by first starting with a more limited pool of words. We could also have some risks defining the board and the rules of the game because they may not translate well into code. Also, we may have trouble finding a way to make everything modular, making it difficult to put different AIs simply into the program.\r\n\r\nAdditional Course Content:\r\nLearn about code efficiency and how to improve the processing speed\r\nTips and tools for creating algorithms","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
