</h1>

<p><em>A project by Shruti Iyer, Meghan Tighe and Paul Krusell</em></p>

<h1>
<a id="project-proposal" class="anchor" href="#project-proposal" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Proposal</h1>

<h2>
<a id="the-big-idea" class="anchor" href="#the-big-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Big Idea:</h2>

<p>The big idea is to create a scrabble game and then create multiple AIs to play each other and determine which one is better. We are thinking of making one AI that plans its moves ahead of time and one that impulsively just chooses the maximum points available at the time.</p>

<h2>
<a id="learning-goals" class="anchor" href="#learning-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning Goals:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Paul: I want to learn about more efficient data structures that will allow our team to process huge numbers of words relatively quickly and efficiently. I think that this will be an important skill for this project and for many projects to come. I especially would love to get a better understanding of algorithms for solving puzzles like this.</li>
<li>Meghan: I would like to learn more about how to better structure my code and how to code with a team (including better use of Github). I also really like the idea of creating an algorithm that solves a problem. Although this project is specific to solving a game of hangman, I think algorithm building is a skill that would be applicable to many other projects.</li>
<li>Shruti: I would like to learn about the architecture of code and how it affects the efficiency and understanding of the code. I would also like to understand how to approach a new library and parse its syntax.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="implementation-plan" class="anchor" href="#implementation-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Implementation Plan:</h2>

<p>The goal is to create a Scrabble AI with a smaller dictionary of words (about the size of 1000 words). We then plan to make two AIs to solve and play scrabble in two different ways. Initially, we just want an ASCII output of the board with Scrabble alphabets. We will build and test one working algorithm and then move to the second one. </p>

<h2>
<a id="project-schedule" class="anchor" href="#project-schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Schedule:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Design Review (4/2):
Have a completed, detailed overview of the code architecture
Pseudocode for the algorithms we will be trying </li>
<li>Code Review (4/13):
Working game
At least one rough but functioning algorithmz</li>
<li>Mid-Project Presentation (4/23):
Two fully functioning algorithms</li>
<li>Final Product (5/6):
Make presentation look pretty.(GUI/Interactive visual interface?)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="collaboration-plan" class="anchor" href="#collaboration-plan" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Collaboration Plan:</h2>

<p>We plan to start out together, pair programming until we have a clear idea about the code architecture and then branch out. We will individually read up on documentation and then get together to pair program. Initially, there won’t be individual parts to work on until we get to the display/GUI portion of the project. </p>

<h2>
<a id="risks" class="anchor" href="#risks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Risks:</h2>

<p>It might end up taking a long time to run because our program will have to cycle through such a long list of words. We are trying to combat this risk by first starting with a more limited pool of words. We could also have some risks defining the board and the rules of the game because they may not translate well into code. Also, we may have trouble finding a way to make everything modular, making it difficult to put different AIs simply into the program.</p>

<h2>
<a id="additional-course-content" class="anchor" href="#additional-course-content" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Course Content:</h2>

<p>Learn about code efficiency and how to improve the processing speed
Tips and tools for creating algorithms</p>

<h2>
<a id="background-and-context" class="anchor" href="#background-and-context" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Background and context</h2>

<p>Our project consists of a Scrabble solver AI.
The game has two different algorithms play against each other. There will also be an option to have the user play against the two algorithms. </p>

<h2>
<a id="key-questions" class="anchor" href="#key-questions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Do you have any advice about code architecture? (Is this the best way for us to structure things?)</li>
<li>Do we have appropriate use of classes?</li>
<li>How should we keep track of tile locations? (Matrix? List?)</li>
<li>Should we use two algorithms with equally good features? Or should one of them be reasonably better than the other? </li>
<li>Do you have any cool algorithm /strategy ideas that we haven’t discussed?</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="agenda-for-technical-review-session" class="anchor" href="#agenda-for-technical-review-session" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Agenda for technical review session</h2>

<ul>
<li>Discuss code overview/architecture</li>
<li>Discuss algorithms being used</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="algorithms" class="anchor" href="#algorithms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Algorithms</h2>

<ol>
<li>Permutations:
Find all places where words could be made
List all permutations with inventory letters
Check list for legal words
Play word with highest score</li>
<li>“Human way”:
Search a dictionary for all words that could be made with inventory letters plus any one other letter
See if the one letter is on board, if word can be placed there
Play word with highest score</li>
<li>Thinking ahead:
Does all the things that #1 does plus somehow thinks ahead.
Saves high score letters for double/triple point spots?
Doesn’t play U alone if also has Q in inventory?
Etc.</li>
<li>“Smart human way”:
Makes list of all letters on board that could have a letter added (spatially, not legally)
Cycles through list: each time makes new alphabetized list that includes inventory plus the letter from board
Searches all combinations of these letters as key in dictionary of all words, element in dictionary is the actual word
Play highest scoring legal word</li>
</ol>
